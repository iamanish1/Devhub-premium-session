    <!-- Section 1: Build a Project -->
    <section id="project">
      <h2>âœ… How to Build a Project from Scratch to Production Level</h2>
      <p>Building a project from scratch to production level is a multi-step process that requires careful planning, execution, and testing. Below is a detailed breakdown:</p>

      <h3>1. Ideation and Problem Identification</h3>
      <p>Start by identifying a real-world problem that your project will solve. Conduct market research to understand the pain points of your target audience. For example, if you're building a task management app, identify issues like lack of collaboration tools or poor task prioritization.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> Trello started as a simple task management tool to help teams collaborate better. It addressed the pain point of disorganized workflows and grew into a widely-used project management platform.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>2. Planning and Roadmapping</h3>
      <p>Create a detailed project roadmap. Define the scope, milestones, and deliverables. Choose the right tech stack (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js for backend). Use tools like Trello or Jira to manage tasks and track progress.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A startup building an e-commerce platform might choose a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for its scalability and flexibility.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>3. Development</h3>
      <p>Write clean, modular, and maintainable code. Follow best practices like code reviews, version control (Git), and continuous integration (CI). Use GitHub for version control and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> Airbnb uses a robust CI/CD pipeline to deploy updates multiple times a day, ensuring rapid delivery of new features and bug fixes.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>4. Folder Structure Formation</h3>
      <p>A well-organized folder structure is crucial for maintaining a scalable and maintainable project. Below is an example of a typical folder structure for a web application:</p>
      <div class="folder-structure">
        <pre>
project-root/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/            # Application pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # API services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/            # Utility functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js            # Main application component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js          # Entry point
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ public/               # Static assets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html        # Main HTML file
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                # Test files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ unit/             # Unit tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ integration/      # Integration tests
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore            # Files to ignore in Git
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Project dependencies
â””â”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation
        </pre>
      </div>

      <h3>5. Testing</h3>
      <p>Perform rigorous testing to ensure the quality of your project. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Use testing frameworks like Jest for JavaScript or PyTest for Python.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> Google uses extensive automated testing to ensure the reliability of its products, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>6. Deployment</h3>
      <p>Deploy your project using platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Vercel. Monitor performance and fix bugs post-deployment. Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deploying web applications.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> Netflix uses AWS for its cloud infrastructure, allowing it to scale seamlessly during peak traffic times.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Craft a Resume -->
    <section id="resume">
      <h2>ðŸ¤¯ How to Craft an ATS-Friendly Resume That Actually Gets Interviews</h2>
      <p>An ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly resume is essential for getting noticed by recruiters. Here's how to create one:</p>

      <h3>1. Use Relevant Keywords</h3>
      <p>Incorporate keywords from the job description to ensure your resume passes ATS filters. For example, if the job requires "Python programming," include it in your skills section.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> A software engineer applying for a backend role tailored their resume by including keywords like "REST APIs," "Node.js," and "Database Optimization."</p>
      </div>

      <h3>2. Keep It Simple and Clean</h3>
      <p>Avoid fancy fonts, graphics, or tables. Use a clean, professional format with clear headings. A single-column layout with standard fonts like Arial or Times New Roman works best.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A candidate used a minimalist resume template and landed interviews at top tech companies like Google and Amazon.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>3. Highlight Achievements</h3>
      <p>Use quantifiable metrics to showcase your impact. For example, "Reduced server response time by 50% through optimization techniques."</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> A DevOps engineer highlighted their achievement of reducing deployment time by 70%, which caught the attention of recruiters.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>4. Tailor for Each Job</h3>
      <p>Customize your resume for every job application to align with the specific requirements. For example, if applying for a frontend role, emphasize your experience with React and JavaScript.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> A frontend developer tailored their resume for a React role and secured an interview within a week.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Build a SaaS -->
    <section id="saas">
      <h2>ðŸ’° How to Build a SaaS for Any Business & Turn It Into a Money-Making Machine</h2>
      <p>Building a SaaS (Software as a Service) product requires a strategic approach. Here's a step-by-step guide:</p>

      <h3>1. Identify a Niche Market</h3>
      <p>Find a specific problem in a niche market that your SaaS can solve. For example, Slack started as a niche tool for team communication and scaled globally.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> Salesforce uses a subscription-based model with tiered pricing, making it accessible to businesses of all sizes.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>4. Scaling and Growth</h3>
      <p>Optimize for performance, expand features, and invest in marketing to grow your user base. Use digital marketing strategies like SEO, content marketing, and paid ads.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Real-World Case:</strong> HubSpot scaled its SaaS platform by investing heavily in content marketing and SEO, becoming a leader in inbound marketing.</p>
      </div>
